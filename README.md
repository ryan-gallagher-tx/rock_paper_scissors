"# rock_paper_scissors" 
A simple command line, text based rock, paper, scissors game that loops, handles incorrect inputs, plays to best 2 out of 3 rounds, and allows for rematches.
I would like to come up with a better solution for if users input an invalid response.
I would like to find a way to shorten/clean up the code.
I would like to be able to play this in a browser instead of through cmd/powershell.
